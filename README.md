# JavaScript-Quiz

## The purpose of this application is to display a timed multiple choice quiz in which the user clicks their selected answer button and the next question appears. When a user gets a question wrong, the timer will subtract 10 seconds from the time. The time will be used as the users score. If the time runs out or the users score hits 0 before all the questions in the quiz are displayed, the quiz will end. Users will input their initials at the end of the quiz and their initials with their corresponding time/ score will be displayed in order from highest score to lowest on a leaderboard.
